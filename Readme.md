This is a small research in which I tried to create a binary classification model that predicts a label of the text
It takes information about part number, part description, HTS code and audit trail and returns "0" if part will receive "passed review" and "1" if part will receive "failed review".

.sql files, .csv files are not presented

Company's name and client's name are hidden

I used bag-of-words model + stemming + stopwords + tf-idf

Four models are presented:

1. logistic regression
2. ridge classifier
3. Naive Bayes classifier
4. Linear SVM
